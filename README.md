This project aims to address food wastage by creating a simple, yet effective, system to manage surplus food listings from providers and facilitate their claims by receivers. It uses a SQLite database as its backend and provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit for data entry, viewing, and analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Get a quick overview of key metrics like total food available, number of providers, and receivers. Visualizations show provider contribution and claim status distribution.
*   **CRUD Operations for Food Listings:**
    *   **Create:** Add new food items with details like name, quantity, expiry date, and provider information.
    *   **Read:** View all available food listings with filtering options by location, provider type, food name, meal type, quantity, and expiry date.
    *   **Update:** Modify the quantity and expiry date of existing food listings.
    *   **Delete:** Remove food listings and their associated claims from the system.
*   **Claims Management:**
    *   **Create:** Submit new claims for available food items. Automated quantity deduction upon successful claim creation.
    *   **Update:** Change the status of a claim (e.g., Pending, Completed, Cancelled).
    *   **Delete:** Remove a claim record.
    *   **View:** Browse all claims with filtering by status and quick access to associated provider/receiver details.
*   **At-Risk Food Tracker:** Identify food items that are expired or expiring soon (within 7 days) and have not yet been claimed, helping prioritize distribution efforts to minimize waste.
*   **Comprehensive Analytical Queries:** Provides insights into various aspects of food distribution, such as:
    *   Number of providers and receivers per city.
    *   Food quantity contributed by different provider types.
    *   Top receivers by claimed food quantity.
    *   Most commonly available food types.
    *   Claims per food item.
    *   Provider performance in successful claims.
    *   Claim status percentages.
    *   Average quantity claimed per receiver.
    *   Most claimed meal types.
    *   Food listings expiring soon.
*   **Raw Dataset Viewer:** Directly inspect the contents of the `Food_Listings`, `Claims`, `Providers`, and `Receivers` tables.
*   **Data Export:** Download filtered or full datasets in CSV format.
*   **Expiry Highlighting:** Visually distinguish expired or soon-to-expire food items in tables for quick action.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **`requirements.txt` content:**
    ```
    streamlit
    pyngrok
    pandas
    numpy
    ```

3.  **Prepare the database:**
    The SQLite database (`food_waste_management.db`) is generated by the Jupyter Notebook. You need to run the notebook first to set up the database and populate it with initial data.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Food_Management (4).ipynb
    ```
    Run all cells in the notebook. This will create `food_waste_management.db` and `app.py`.

4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your Streamlit app will open in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Google Colab Deployment

The project is designed to be easily runnable in Google Colab, leveraging its environment for file uploads and `pyngrok` for public sharing.

1.  **Open the Notebook:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload `Food_Management (4).ipynb`.
2.  **Upload Data Files:** In the Colab environment, use the file upload feature (usually available on the left sidebar under "Files") to upload the four CSV files:
    *   `claims_data.csv`
    *   `food_listings_data.csv`
    *   `providers_data.csv`
    *   `receivers_data.csv`
3.  **Run All Cells:** Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially (`Runtime > Run all`).
    *   The notebook will install necessary libraries.
    *   It will prompt you to upload the CSV files.
    *   It will create and populate the SQLite database.
    *   It will generate the `app.py` script.
    *   Finally, it will start the Streamlit app and provide an `ngrok` public URL for you to access it from anywhere. You will need to obtain an `ngrok` auth token from [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and paste it into the designated cell in the notebook.

## üìä Analytical Queries

The project provides insights through 15 predefined SQL queries covering various aspects of food management:

1.  Number of food providers and receivers in each city.
2.  Food quantity contributed by each provider type.
3.  Contact information of food providers in a specific city.
4.  Top 10 receivers by total food claimed (completed claims).
5.  Total quantity of food available from all providers.
6.  Top 10 cities with the highest number of food listings.
7.  Top 10 most commonly available food types.
8.  Top 10 food items with the most claims made.
9.  Top 10 providers with the highest number of successful food claims.
10. Percentage of food claims by status.
11. Top 10 receivers by average quantity of food claimed per successful claim.
12. Claims and quantities by meal type.
13. Top 10 providers by total quantity of food donated.
14. Food listings expiring within a custom number of days from a given date.
15. Food listings by specific provider type and food location.

These queries are executed and displayed within the Streamlit application under the "Analytical Queries" tab.
